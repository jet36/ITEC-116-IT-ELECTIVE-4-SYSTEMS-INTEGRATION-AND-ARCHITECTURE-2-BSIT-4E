# ITEC 116 - Systems Integration and Architecture (API Laboratory)
Welcome to the laboratory Activities for ITEC 116: Systems Integration and Architecture! This repository contains hands-on exercises designed to help you master API development and integration, focusing on building modern, secure, and scalable APIs with FastAPI. Along the way, we also explore tools like Swagger UI to make API interaction and testing easier and more intuitive.
These labs combine technical skills with best practices, preparing you to tackle real-world projects and challenges in systems integration.

# Laboratory 1: Introduction to FastAPI for API Development
In this first laboratory, you'll be introduced to FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI is known for its speed and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to create fast, scalable, and secure web applications.

This lab is all about getting hands-on with FastAPI and strengthening your coding skills by building and testing your own API. Youâ€™ll also review Python as the programming language of choice for API development, diving into its capabilities for logic building and handling data processing.

# Laboratory 2: Working with HTTP Methods and API Parameters 
In this laboratory, you will expand your knowledge of FastAPI by learning how to handle API parameters and use different HTTP methods effectively. These are essential skills for developing APIs that follow best practices and allow smooth data interaction. By the end of this activity, you will have built a fully functional To-Do List API that can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

# Laboratory 3: Working with JSON in FastAPI
In this lab, you will explore JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is the most commonly used data format for structuring and exchanging information in APIs. JSON allows applications to communicate by sending and receiving structured data in a human-readable format.

By working with JSON in FastAPI, you will:
  Parse JSON data to extract meaningful information.
  Traverse JSON structures, including nested data such as user posts and comments.
  Return JSON responses in a properly formatted structure using FastAPI.

  # Laboratory 4: API Versioning, Authentication, and Exception Handling
In this lab, you will improve your existing API by implementing versioning, authentication using API keys, and proper HTTP exception handling. Versioning ensures that older versions of the API remain accessible while allowing updates and improvements in newer versions. Authentication using API keys enhances security by restricting access to authorized users, with the API key stored securely in a .env file to prevent exposure. Proper HTTP exception handling ensures that users receive clear and meaningful error messages, such as a 404 Not Found response for missing tasks or a 204 No Content response when there are no tasks available. Additionally, status codes like 201 Created for adding a task and 204 No Content for updating or deleting a task provide structured and standardized responses. These enhancements make the API more secure, scalable, and user-friendly while following best practices in API development.

  # Laboratory 5: Student Portfolio 
  In this final activity, you will compile all the laboratory exercises completed throughout the course into a single GitHub repository. Each activity should be placed in its own separate folder to maintain organization and clarity. Additionally, you must create a README.md file for each folder, providing a clear and detailed description of the activity. The README should include an overview of the activity, its objectives, the technologies used, and instructions on how to run the code. This compilation will serve as a structured portfolio of your work, making it easier for others to understand and navigate through your projects. Proper documentation ensures that your repository is professional, informative, and useful for future reference or collaboration.
