                ITEC 116 - Systems Integration and Architecture

Welcome to the laboratory Activities for ITEC 116: Systems Integration and Architecture! This repository contains hands-on exercises designed to help you master API development and integration, focusing on building modern, secure, and scalable APIs with FastAPI. Along the way, we also explore tools like Swagger UI to make API interaction and testing easier and more intuitive.
These labs combine technical skills with best practices, preparing you to tackle real-world projects and challenges in systems integration.

Laboratory 1: Introduction to FastAPI for API Development
In this first laboratory, you'll be introduced to FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI is known for its speed and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to create fast, scalable, and secure web applications.

This lab is all about getting hands-on with FastAPI and strengthening your coding skills by building and testing your own API. Youâ€™ll also review Python as the programming language of choice for API development, diving into its capabilities for logic building and handling data processing.
