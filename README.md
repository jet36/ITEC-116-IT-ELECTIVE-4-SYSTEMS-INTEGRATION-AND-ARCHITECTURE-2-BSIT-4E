# ITEC 116 - Systems Integration and Architecture
Welcome to the laboratory Activities for ITEC 116: Systems Integration and Architecture! This repository contains hands-on exercises designed to help you master API development and integration, focusing on building modern, secure, and scalable APIs with FastAPI. Along the way, we also explore tools like Swagger UI to make API interaction and testing easier and more intuitive.
These labs combine technical skills with best practices, preparing you to tackle real-world projects and challenges in systems integration.

# Laboratory 1: Introduction to FastAPI for API Development
In this first laboratory, you'll be introduced to FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI is known for its speed and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to create fast, scalable, and secure web applications.

This lab is all about getting hands-on with FastAPI and strengthening your coding skills by building and testing your own API. Youâ€™ll also review Python as the programming language of choice for API development, diving into its capabilities for logic building and handling data processing.

# Laboratory 2: Working with HTTP Methods and API Parameters
In this laboratory, you will expand your knowledge of FastAPI by learning how to handle API parameters and use different HTTP methods effectively. These are essential skills for developing APIs that follow best practices and allow smooth data interaction. By the end of this activity, you will have built a fully functional To-Do List API that can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

# Laboratory 3: Working with JSON in FastAPI
In this lab, you will explore JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is the most commonly used data format for structuring and exchanging information in APIs. JSON allows applications to communicate by sending and receiving structured data in a human-readable format.

By working with JSON in FastAPI, you will:
  # Parse JSON data to extract meaningful information.
 #  Traverse JSON structures, including nested data such as user posts and comments.
 #  Return JSON responses in a properly formatted structure using FastAPI.
